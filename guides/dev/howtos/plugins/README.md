## How Do I Create My Own CKEditor Plugins?

CKEditor architecture is based on plugins, so if you want to customize the editor behavior or introduce your own functionality, creating a custom plugin is the best way to achieve this.

Some useful resources that you can start with are:

* [CKEditor plugin tutorials](#!/guide/tutorials) – step-by-step instructions that show you how to start, how to create a plugin toolbar button, how to create a plugin dialog window etc.
* [CKEditor JavaScript API](#!/api) – the full CKEditor API reference that describes all CKEditor methods, events, and configuration values.
* CKEditor samples distributed with the installation package that can be found in the `samples/` and `plugins/`*`plugin_name`*`/samples/` directories of CKEditor. Pay special attention to plugin samples.

You can also search the Internet for third-party plugins and tutorials. You are most welcome to share your efforts on our [community forum](http://cksource.com/forums/) where you can also find some plugins developed by other Open Source-minded people like you.


## Where Can I Share or Download CKEditor Plugins?

We have a dedicated **[CKEditor Add-Ons Forum](http://cksource.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=17) in our community forum where you can post your plugins and skins in order to share them with fellow developers.
