# Issues Tracker Site

CKEditor issues are handled in the [CKEditor Developer Center](http://dev.ckeditor.com/). This is the website used daily by the CKEditor core team to organize and distribute the development workflow. It is also the right place to report issues.

Before you attempt to report an issue, please be sure to read this page fully, helping us optimizing the issue management. 

## Required Information

Please provide the following when reporting new issues. The more information you provide, the quicker the issue may be solved:

 * **Descriptive summary**: A "right to the point" phrase that best summarizes the issue that you are having.
 * **Steps to reproduce**: This is the most important thing. We are not able to fix a issue if we cannot see it with our own eyes. A numbered list of actions to reproduce the issue is quite useful.
 * **Browser name and OS**: Your computer configuration, OS, browser name and version.
 * **Screenshot**: For interface related issues an image speaks more than thousands of words.
 * **Sample data**: For content related issues please attach a sample file from which we can get the text for testing.
 * **Test case file**: If possible, attach a Test Case file showing the issue. This is the best way to show us the problem, making it quicker to solve it.

## Important

While filing the issue please bear these important things in mind:

 * **Submit different reports for each issue.** Do not include more than one issue in the same report.
 * The "Priority", "Milestone", and "Assign to" fields are reserved to the core development team.
 * **Avoid using the "Keywords" field** if you are not 100% sure on what to put there.
 * Make sure **you are using the latest version of CKEditor**. Maybe your issue has already been fixed.
