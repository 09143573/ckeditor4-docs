# Reporting Issues

If you feel you found a issue in CKEditor, we will be grateful for letting us know.

## Reproduce on Demo Page

To eliminate the chance that the issue might be caused by some third-party software or your customizations, try to reproduce the issue on the [CKEditor demo page](http://ckeditor.com/demo) first.

Most of the issues are reproducible on the demo. If you have a different case though, no problem. Go ahead with the next steps.

## Avoid Duplicates

Before you file a new ticket, make sure your issue has not been already reported. Use the [search page](https://dev.ckeditor.com/search) to check it.

There is a chance that we already fixed your issue, so you should also test it on our last "Nightly Build":
