# Licensing and Support


## How Do I Get Support?

If you are having trouble installing, configuring, or integrating CKEditor to your application, there are a few solutions that you can try.


### Documentation

First of all, CKEditor comes with really extensive [documentation](#!/guide) that you should read. You will find things like:

* The [User's Guide](#!/guide/user) – describes all editor features from the user's perspective. It is the best resource if you want to learn about what CKEditor can offer to the users of your website and also to decide which features you want to use and which ones to disable if you do not need them.
* The [Developer's Guide](#!/guide/dev) – a must-read for all developers who want to [install](#!/guide/dev_installation), [configure](#!/guide/dev_configuration), or [integrate](#!/guide/dev_integration) CKEditor into their websites.
* The [CKEditor HOWTOs](#!/guide/howtos) – a series of most frequently asked questions and short answers that should explain different aspects of the editor in a concise way and send you to some helpful resources that you were unable to find by yourself.
* The [CKEditor Tutorials](#!/guide/tutorials) – a few step-by-step tutorials on creating CKEditor plugins.
* The [JavaScript API](#!/api) – API documentation with all {@link CKEDITOR.config CKEditor configuration options}, internal methods, events etc. Indispensible when you want to configure CKEditor to your specific needs, extend it, create plugins, etc.

### Support Channel

There are times and situations, however, when you are unable to get going by yourself. If this is a case, you will be happy to learn that [all commercial CKEditor licenses](http://ckeditor.com/license) (CKSource Closed Distribution License – CDL) include [professional assistance](http://ckeditor.com/support) from the CKEditor development team. The dedicated support channel is available for you and responses to your inquiries come in one business day, or even in the same day.


### Community Forum

Last but not least, for all users of the Open Source editor version, there is a [free community forum](http://cksource.com/forums/) where CKEditor developers and integrators can share their problems and solutions. CKEditor has grown as an Open Source product, thanks to the amazing community of developers and users. The community forum works in true Open Source fashion, so you are encouraged to not only ask questions, but also answer them and help fellow developers. It will be much appreciated!


## How Do I Support the Development of CKEditor?

CKEditor is and has always been an Open Source product. We are proud to be a part of the [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) movement and are happy that we can offer the result of long hours of our work **completely for free** to everyone who wants to use the editor.

We managed to [build a company](http://cksource.com/) based on the success of our free editor. We cannot accept donations for our work, so the cost of the editor development and enhancements is covered from the commercial licenses that are available.

If you appreciate our work and want to support the development of CKEditor, it will be most welcome. Here are a couple of things that you can do:

* Buy a [commercial CKEditor license](http://ckeditor.com/license). This will not only let you support the development of new editor features, but it will also give you access to a [dedicated support channel](http://ckeditor.com/support) where CKEditor developers are available to help you solve any issues you might have.
* Report bugs or feature requests and submit patches on our [Development site](http://dev.ckeditor.com/).
* Help [localize CKEditor](#!/guide/contrib_localization) into your native language and update existing localizations by joining us at the [CKEditor UI Translation Center](https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ckeditor/).
* Create CKEditor plugins with new functionality and publish them on the [CKEditor Add-Ons Forum](http://cksource.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=17).
* Join the [Community Forum](http://cksource.com/forums/) and share your knowledge with your fellow CKEditor users and developers.

**Thank you for your support and for helping us make CKEditor better every day!**


## How Do I Know Which CKEditor License Is Appropriate for Me?

CKEditor is distributed under both Open Source ([GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), LGPL or MPL) and commercial licenses.

More information about CKEditor licensing options is available here: [http://ckeditor.com/license](http://ckeditor.com/license). The full text of the CKSource Closed Distribution License Agreement is available here: [http://cksource.com/cdl](http://cksource.com/cdl).

If you are not sure which licensing model is appropriate for your CKEditor usage, please [use our contact form](http://cksource.com/contact) to describe your business model and needs.


## How Do I Know if I Can Use the Free Open Source License?

It depends on your usage scenario. You need to verify that it fulfills the terms of the Open Source license. CKEditor can be used in two [licensing models](http://ckeditor.com/license):

* **CKEditor Open Source License** – the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html), and [MPL](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) copyleft license.
* **CKEditor Commercial License** – **CKSource Closed Distribution License (CDL)** – commercial non-copyleft license.

If you want to take advantage of one of the **Open Source licenses**, you need to be sure that you are compliant with their terms. Some things to look at are:

* Whether you plan to release your application under an Open Source license.
* Whether you want to modify CKEditor and under which license you want to release your modifications.
* Whether you intend to distribute the Open Source license terms and the source code of CKEditor with your product.
* Whether you want to keep the references to CKEditor in your product as well as preserve the integrity of all CKEditor files.
* Whether you want to support the future development of CKEditor by buying a commercial version.
* Whether you are going to need access to the [support channel](http://ckeditor.com/support) which is only available with the commercial licenses.

Please note that the CKEditor Open Source license can be used in personal, educational, non-profit, and commercial products as long **as you satisfy all terms of the Open Source license of your choice**.


## How Does the Commercial License Renewal Work?

All commercial CKEditor licenses (CKSource Closed Distribution License (CDL)) are *lifetime* and *perpetual*. Your right to use and distribute the purchased software never expires.

Each purchase also gives you the right to upgrade CKEditor to all newer versions released within a year after you buy a license as well as to use the dedicated support channel during this time. After a year from the date of your purchase your access to the support channel is terminated and you can no longer upgrade CKEditor to versions released after this time.

Each license can be renewed yearly at a discounted price in order to make it possible for you to take advantage of latest editor versions and maintain access to professional assistance from the CKEditor development team. To renew your license, just go the the official [CKEditor website](http://ckeditor.com/license) and scroll to the **License Renewal** section.
